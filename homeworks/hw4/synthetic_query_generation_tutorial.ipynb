    "- ✅ Implement parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "- ✅ Validate query quality and filter low-quality examples\n",
    "- ✅ Optimize costs for large-scale query generation\n",
    "- ✅ Export queries in evaluation-ready format\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "Query 1: I'm trying to make a baked good with a nice, crumbly texture, but I'm not sure how to properly incorporate the butter into the flour mixture. What technique should I use, and what’s the best baking temperature and time to ensure it turns out perfectly?\n",
      "Source Recipe: all purpose quick mix with 28 variations\n",
      "Salient Fact: 1. **Baking Temperature and Time**: The recipe specifies to \"bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until done.\" This precise temperature and timing detail is crucial for achieving the desired texture and doneness of the baked goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preparation Technique**: The instruction to \"cut butter or margarine into flour mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal\" is a specific technique that involves a method known as \"cutting in.\" This detail is important for achieving the right consistency in the mixture, which can be difficult to determine without this guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "Query 2: What water temperature should I use for my bread dough to make sure the yeast activates properly, and how long will it take to rise if I use that?\n",
      "Source Recipe: 5 minute artisan bread\n",
      "Salient Fact: 1. **Specific Cooking Techniques/Methods**: The recipe specifies that the dough should be prepared with \"warm water slightly warmer than body temperature,\" which is crucial for activating the yeast properly. This detail is essential for achieving the right dough consistency and fermentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Timing Specifics**: The recipe indicates that using warm water will allow the dough to rise to the right point for storage in about **2 hours**, while using cold water will require **3-4 hours**. This timing is critical for anyone looking to ensure proper fermentation and storage of the dough.\n",
      "\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "Query 3: How do I make sure the vegetables in my soup are tender but not mushy, especially after I sauté them? What's the best way to transition to simmering, and how long should I let it simmer after adding the herbs?\n",
      "Source Recipe: 7 day diet fat burning cabbage soup\n",
      "Salient Fact: 1. **Cooking Technique/Method**: \"Saute all veggies except for cabbage and tomatoes in vegetable oil or coconut oil, cover with water, bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer till veggies are tender.\" This specific sequence of cooking steps, particularly the transition from sautéing to simmering, is a technical detail that is crucial for achieving the desired texture and flavor in the soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Timing Specifics**: \"Simmer till veggies are tender\" followed by \"simmer 5 minutes\" after adding fresh or dried herbs. The timing of these steps is essential for ensuring that the vegetables are cooked properly without becoming mushy, and the additional simmering time for the herbs allows their flavors to infuse into the soup effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "Query 4: What's the right batter consistency for making fritters, and how long should I expect to cook them for?\n",
      "Source Recipe: alligator claws avocado fritters with chipotle lime dip\n",
      "Salient Fact: Based on the provided recipe for alligator claws avocado fritters with chipotle lime dip, the following specific technical details stand out as distinctive facts that would be difficult to generate from scratch but are clearly answerable by this exact recipe:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cooking Techniques/Methods**: The recipe implies a specific batter preparation method, which is a one-to-one mix of flour and water. This detail is crucial for achieving the right consistency for the fritters, and it is not a common knowledge detail that one might easily guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Timing Specifics**: The overall cooking time is specified as **45 minutes**. This detail is essential for planning and ensuring that the fritters are cooked properly, and it may not be intuitive for someone unfamiliar with fritter preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These details provide clear guidance on both the preparation and cooking process, making them valuable for anyone attempting to recreate the dish.\n",

      "Source Recipe: 5 cheese crab lasagna with roasted garlic and vegetables\n",
      "Salient Fact: 1. **Specific Cooking Techniques/Methods**: The recipe specifies to \"roast garlic: place oven rack on second notch turn oven to 375 degrees F,\" which indicates both the cooking method (roasting) and the precise oven temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appliance Settings**: The recipe requires the oven to be set at \"375 degrees F,\" which is a specific temperature setting that is crucial for the roasting process and overall cooking of the lasagna. \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Loaded and explored processed recipe dataset  \n",
    "✅ Implemented two-step query generation (facts → queries)  \n",
    "✅ Built parallel processing pipeline with ThreadPoolExecutor  \n",
    "✅ Generated sample queries with quality validation  \n",
    "✅ Analyzed costs and optimization strategies  \n",
    "✅ Exported queries in evaluation-ready format  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale up**: Generate 100+ queries for comprehensive evaluation\n",
    "2. **Manual review**: Validate 10-20% of queries for quality\n",
    "3. **Retrieval evaluation**: Use [Retrieval Metrics Tutorial](retrieval_metrics_tutorial.md)\n",
    "4. **BM25 evaluation**: Run `scripts/evaluate_retrieval.py`\n",
    "5. **Analyze results**: Identify query types that work well vs. poorly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Two-step generation produces better queries** - Facts → queries is superior to direct generation\n",
    "- ✅ **Parallel processing enables scale** - 10x speedup with ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "- ✅ **Quality validation is critical** - Check length, diversity, conversational style\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost optimization matters** - Use GPT-4o-mini, start small, iterate\n",
    "- ✅ **Salient facts drive specificity** - Technical details make queries challenging\n",
