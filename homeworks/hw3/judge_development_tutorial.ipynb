    "\n",
    "By completing this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- ✅ Engineer effective judge prompts with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "- ✅ Select strategic few-shot examples from the train set\n",
    "- ✅ Use structured output with Pydantic models for reliable parsing\n",
    "- ✅ Iteratively refine prompts using the dev set\n",
    "- ✅ Measure judge performance using TPR/TNR metrics\n",
    "- ✅ Analyze and debug common judge errors\n",
    "- ✅ Create confusion matrices and error visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completed [Data Labeling Tutorial](data_labeling_tutorial.ipynb)\n",
    "- Have train/dev/test splits ready\n",
    "- Understanding of TPR/TNR metrics from [LLM-as-Judge Concepts](llm_judge_concepts.md)\n",

      "Reasoning: The recipe for the Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Quinoa Salad includes quinoa, which is a grain that is relatively high in carbohydrates. The use of 1/2 cup of quinoa contributes approximately 30g of carbohydrates, which exceeds the typical low-carb limit of 50g per day. Additionally, while the chicken and vegetables are low in carbs, the overall carbohydrate content of the dish is too high to be considered low-carb. Therefore, this recipe does not adhere to the low-carb dietary restriction.\n",

    "\n",
    "**If TPR is low (<0.85)** - Judge is too strict:\n",
    "- ✅ Clarify PASS criteria more explicitly\n",
    "- ✅ Add few-shot examples showing edge cases that should pass\n",
    "- ✅ Emphasize \"be reasonable\" in evaluation instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**If TNR is low (<0.85)** - Judge is too lenient:\n",
    "- ✅ Strengthen FAIL criteria with explicit violations\n",
    "- ✅ Add few-shot examples showing subtle violations\n",
    "- ✅ Emphasize \"be strict\" in evaluation instructions\n",
    "- ✅ Include edge cases in few-shot (honey in vegan, gluten in soy sauce)\n",
    "\n",
    "**General improvements:**\n",
    "- ✅ Add more diverse few-shot examples (more than 4)\n",
    "- ✅ Include reasoning in few-shot examples\n",
    "- ✅ Use a higher-quality judge model (GPT-4o instead of GPT-4o-mini)\n",
    "- ✅ Add specific failure modes you've identified from error analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate on dev set (above)\n",
    "2. Analyze errors (false positives/negatives)\n",
    "3. Refine prompt based on patterns\n",
    "4. Re-evaluate on dev set\n",
    "5. Repeat 3-5 times maximum (avoid overfitting!)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Loaded train/dev/test splits  \n",
    "✅ Selected strategic few-shot examples (1 PASS : 3 FAIL ratio)  \n",
    "✅ Constructed comprehensive judge prompt with dietary definitions  \n",
    "✅ Tested judge on dev set sample  \n",
    "✅ Calculated TPR and TNR metrics  \n",
    "✅ Created confusion matrix visualization  \n",
    "✅ Analyzed false positives and false negatives  \n",
    "✅ Identified improvement strategies  \n",
    "✅ Saved judge prompt and evaluation results  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Refine prompt** based on error analysis (iterate 2-3 times on dev set)\n",
    "2. **Final test set evaluation**: Use `scripts/evaluate_judge.py` on test set (ONCE ONLY!)\n",
    "3. **Apply to production data**: Use `scripts/run_full_evaluation.py` on large dataset\n",
    "4. **Statistical correction**: Apply [Bias Correction Tutorial](bias_correction_tutorial.md) with judgy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Few-shot examples are critical** - Choose diverse, representative cases\n",
    "- ✅ **TPR/TNR reveal judge bias** - Optimize based on your use case priorities\n",
    "- ✅ **Error analysis guides refinement** - False positives/negatives show blind spots\n",
    "- ✅ **Iterate on dev set only** - Limit to 3-5 iterations to avoid overfitting\n",
    "- ✅ **Test set is sacred** - Evaluate once at the end\n",
    "- ✅ **Model choice matters** - Premium models (GPT-4o) have higher TPR/TNR\n",
