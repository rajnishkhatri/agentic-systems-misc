    "\n",
    "### Judge Performance Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we engineered judges for 5 different evaluation criteria and measured their quality using TPR/TNR metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Judge Quality Varies by Criterion**: Some criteria (e.g., toxicity, coherence) are easier to judge than others (e.g., dietary adherence, factual correctness)\n",
    "2. **TPR vs TNR Trade-off**: High TPR (catching failures) may come at the cost of lower TNR (false alarms), and vice versa\n",
    "3. **Balanced Accuracy Matters**: For imbalanced datasets, balanced accuracy is more informative than raw accuracy\n",
    "4. **Prompt Engineering is Critical**: Clear criteria definitions lead to more consistent judgments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate on Ground Truth**: Always test judges on a labeled dataset before deployment\n",
    "2. **Monitor Performance**: Track TPR/TNR over time to detect drift\n",
    "3. **Iterate on Prompts**: Refine criteria descriptions based on error analysis\n",
    "4. **Use Few-Shot Examples**: Add 3-5 examples to improve consistency (not shown here, but see HW3)\n",
    "5. **Consider Model Selection**: GPT-4o for high-stakes decisions, GPT-4o-mini for development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias Detection**: Run the judge_bias_detection_tutorial.ipynb to identify and mitigate biases\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Learning**: Experiment with adding examples to prompts (see HW3)\n",
    "- **Multi-Judge Ensembles**: Use multiple judges and aggregate their decisions\n",
    "- **Production Integration**: Deploy judges with proper batching, retry logic, and observability\n",
