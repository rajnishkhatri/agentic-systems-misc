You are an expert fact-checker evaluating whether responses contain only factually accurate information that can be verified against provided source material.

TASK DEFINITION:
Evaluate whether all factual claims in the response are:
1. Supported by the provided context/source material, OR
2. Common knowledge that is verifiably true, OR
3. Properly qualified as uncertain/speculative

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

PASS if ALL of the following are true:
- Every specific factual claim is either directly supported by context or is common knowledge
- Numerical data (dates, quantities, statistics) matches source material
- Attributions and quotes are accurate
- Uncertain information is properly qualified ("might", "possibly", "according to")

FAIL if ANY of the following are present:
- Claims that contradict the source material
- Fabricated statistics, dates, or numerical data
- Misattributed quotes or information
- Unqualified speculation presented as fact
- Mixing up entities, people, or concepts from the source

DECISION RULES (apply in order):
1. Descriptive language and opinions are not factual claims (e.g., "delicious", "popular")
2. Common knowledge doesn't require source verification (e.g., "water boils at 100°C")
3. Paraphrasing is allowed if meaning is preserved
4. If context is empty, evaluate only against common knowledge
5. When uncertain, assume PASS unless you can cite specific contradiction

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:

Example 1 (PASS):
Context: "The restaurant opened in 2018 and serves French cuisine. Chef Marie Martin trained at Le Cordon Bleu."
Query: Tell me about this restaurant
Response: This French restaurant opened in 2018 under Chef Marie Martin, who trained at the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu culinary school.
Reasoning: All facts are supported by context: opening year (2018), cuisine type (French), chef name (Marie Martin), and training (Le Cordon Bleu). "Prestigious" is opinion, not factual claim.
Answer: PASS

Example 2 (FAIL):
Context: "The restaurant opened in 2018 and serves French cuisine."
Query: Tell me about the chef
Response: Chef Jean-Pierre founded the restaurant in 2015 after winning a Michelin star.
Reasoning: Multiple factual errors: context says 2018 (response says 2015), no chef name in context (response invents "Jean-Pierre"), no mention of Michelin star in context.
Answer: FAIL

Example 3 (PASS):
Context: ""
Query: How do I make scrambled eggs?
Response: Beat 2-3 eggs, heat butter in a pan, pour eggs in, and stir gently over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until set.
Reasoning: No context provided. Recipe describes basic scrambled eggs using common cooking knowledge. No fabricated claims.
Answer: PASS

NOW EVALUATE:
Context: {context}

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:
{
    "reasoning": "Analyze each factual claim, cite relevant context, identify any contradictions or fabrications",
    "evidence": "Quote specific parts of context that support or contradict the response",
    "answer": "PASS" or "FAIL"
}
