This moderate temperature allows the cookies to bake evenly, with the edges becoming golden and slightly crispy while the centers remain soft and chewy. Baking time typically ranges from 10 to 12 minutes, depending on your oven and cookie size. Watch for visual cues: the edges should be set and lightly golden, while the centers may still look slightly underdone. Remember, cookies continue cooking on the hot baking sheet even after removal from the oven, so don't overbake!\",\n",

Al dente means the pasta is cooked through but still has a slight firmness when bitten. To cook pasta properly, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil, add the pasta, and stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Start testing the pasta a minute or two before the package's suggested cooking time by removing a piece and biting into it. The pasta should be tender but still offer a bit of resistance. Remember that pasta continues to cook slightly after draining, so it's better to err on the side of slightly underdone if you're adding it to a sauce.\",\n",

    "## Mitigation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Address Detected Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-Preference Bias\n",
    "- ✅ **Use different model for judging**: Don't use GPT-4o to judge GPT-4o outputs\n",
    "- ✅ **Blind evaluation**: Don't mention which model generated the response\n",
    "- ✅ **Cross-validation**: Use multiple judges from different model families\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Position Bias\n",
    "- ✅ **Position swapping**: Always evaluate both orders (A vs B, B vs A) and aggregate\n",
    "- ✅ **Randomize presentation**: Shuffle positions randomly for each comparison\n",
    "- ✅ **Use absolute judgments**: Judge responses independently, not comparatively\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verbosity Bias\n",
    "- ✅ **Length normalization**: Explicitly instruct judge to ignore length\n",
    "- ✅ **Truncation testing**: Test with truncated versions to see if scores change\n",
    "- ✅ **Prompt modification**: Add instruction like \"Favor concise answers over verbose ones\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying judges in production:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Test for self-preference bias with 20+ examples\n",
    "- [ ] Test for position bias with 20+ pairs (evaluate both orders)\n",
    "- [ ] Test for verbosity bias with length-controlled examples\n",
    "- [ ] Measure consistency: Run same input multiple times\n",
    "- [ ] Validate against ground truth: 50+ labeled examples\n",
    "- [ ] Document bias detection results in evaluation report\n",
    "- [ ] Implement mitigation strategies for detected biases\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor bias metrics over time (track in production)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Biases are common**: Most judges exhibit some form of bias\n",
    "2. **Detection is critical**: Don't assume your judge is unbiased\n",
    "3. **Mitigation is possible**: Simple techniques (position swapping, blind evaluation) are effective\n",
    "4. **Monitor continuously**: Biases can change as models are updated\n",
    "5. **Document everything**: Keep records of bias tests for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production Deployment**: Apply mitigation strategies to your judges\n",
    "- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up automated bias detection in production\n",
    "- **Ensemble Judges**: Use multiple judges and aggregate their decisions\n",
    "- **Human Validation**: Periodically validate judge decisions with human reviewers\n",
