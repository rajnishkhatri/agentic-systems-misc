"""Integration tests for Lesson 16 - Agent Reliability.

This package contains comprehensive end-to-end integration tests that validate
the complete reliability framework across all components:
- Reliability components (retry, circuit breaker, checkpoint, etc.)
- Orchestration patterns (sequential, hierarchical, iterative, state machine, voting)
- Benchmark framework (task generation, metrics, runner)
- Datasets (invoices, transactions, reconciliation)
- Notebooks and tutorials integration

These tests ensure all modules work together correctly in production-like scenarios.
