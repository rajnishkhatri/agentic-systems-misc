    "## Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Voting/ensemble orchestration pattern** - Multi-agent consensus with parallel execution and aggregation strategies\n",
    "2. **5-agent voting system** - Redundant fraud detection with majority vote, weighted consensus, and outlier rejection\n",
    "3. **Parallel execution with ThreadPoolExecutor** - All agents execute concurrently (latency = max, not sum)\n",
    "4. **Outlier rejection using Z-score** - Statistical filtering of extreme predictions (>1.5 standard deviations)\n",
    "5. **40% error reduction achieved** - Voting ensemble reduces errors compared to single agent baseline (FR3.5)\n",
    "6. **5× cost multiplier** - 5 agents = 5× LLM calls, justified for high-stakes decisions (>$10K transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error reduction: 25-40%** - Voting reduces errors through redundancy and consensus (measured vs single agent)\n",
    "- **Cost-benefit for high stakes** - 5× LLM cost ($2-5) negligible vs potential fraud loss ($10K-$100K)\n",
    "- **Parallel execution efficiency** - Latency ~0.1s (max agent time) not 0.5s (sum of 5 agents)\n",
    "- **Outlier rejection improves consensus** - Filtering extreme predictions (Z-score >1.5) prevents single bad agent from corrupting result\n",
    "- **Majority vote vs weighted consensus** - Majority vote: simple, robust; Weighted: uses confidence, better calibrated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use voting for high-stakes decisions** - When cost of error >> cost of LLM calls (fraud >$10K, medical diagnosis, legal review)\n",
    "2. **Start with 3 agents, scale to 5 if needed** - 3 agents: 3× cost, 80% of benefit; 5 agents: 5× cost, maximum reliability\n",
    "3. **Enable outlier rejection** - Z-score >1.5 filtering prevents single bad agent from corrupting consensus\n",
    "4. **Monitor agent diversity** - If all agents agree 100%, redundancy not needed (reduce to 1 agent to save cost)\n",
    "5. **Use weighted consensus for calibrated agents** - If agents provide well-calibrated confidence scores, weighted average better than majority vote\n",
    "6. **Track cost per decision** - Set budget thresholds: $10K transaction = 5 agents OK, $1K transaction = 1 agent sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voting vs Hierarchical Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Hierarchical (Notebook 9) | Voting (This Notebook) |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Error Reduction** | 15-25% (moderate) | 25-40% (high) |\n",
    "| **Latency** | 0.07s (parallel specialists) | 0.1s (parallel agents) |\n",
    "| **Cost** | 1.3× (planner + 3 specialists) | 5× (5 agents) |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Decomposable tasks (fraud = transaction + merchant + behavior) | Indivisible decisions (fraud yes/no) |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Limited by task decomposition | Linear (add more agents) |\n",
    "| **When to Use** | Complex multi-facet analysis | High-stakes binary decisions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 1: Over-voting on low-stakes decisions** - Using 5 agents for $100 transaction wastes money. Use decision tree: >$10K = 5 agents, $1K-$10K = 3 agents, <$1K = 1 agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 2: Ignoring agent diversity** - If all 5 agents use same model/prompt, they'll make same mistakes. Use diverse agents (different models, prompts, or training data) for true redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 3: Majority vote with uncalibrated agents** - If agents are overconfident (high confidence + wrong), majority vote propagates errors. Enable outlier rejection or use weighted consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 4: Sequential execution of voting agents** - If agents execute one-by-one (sequential), latency = 5× single agent. Use ThreadPoolExecutor parallel execution (latency = max agent time).\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 5: Not tracking cost per decision** - Voting cost adds up fast: 1000 decisions × 5 agents = 5000 LLM calls. Monitor cost_tracker and set budget alerts."
