    "3. **Demonstrate max iteration limits** - Enforce 3-5 iteration cap to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "4. **Track progress validation** - Verify discrepancy decreases each iteration\n",

    "## Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterative refinement pattern (ReAct/Reflexion)** - Action-reflection-refinement loop where agents improve outputs through self-reflection\n",
    "2. **Convergence detection working** - 60%+ tasks converge within 3 iterations by progressively relaxing tolerance\n",
    "3. **Progress validation ensures improvement** - Discrepancy decreases monotonically each iteration (no regression)\n",
    "4. **Max iteration limits prevent infinite loops** - Hard cap at 5 iterations enforced, stops even if not converged\n",
    "5. **Reflection insights guide strategy evolution** - Date tolerance (±0→±3 days), amount tolerance ($0→$1) adjusted based on failure analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **60-80% convergence within 3 iterations** - Most date mismatches and rounding errors resolvable with moderate tolerance\n",
    "- **Average 2-3 iterations per task** - Simple matches resolve quickly, hard challenges use 4-5 iterations\n",
    "- **Reflection quality critical** - Good reflections identify specific failure modes (date vs amount vs duplicate) and suggest targeted fixes\n",
    "- **Cost scales with iterations** - 2.1× cost multiplier vs sequential (avg 2.1 iterations × ~600 tokens vs 3 steps × 500 tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use iterative for ambiguous/noisy inputs** - When first attempt unlikely to succeed (OCR errors, fuzzy matching, conflicting data)\n",
    "2. **Set appropriate convergence thresholds** - Too strict (< $0.01) may never converge, too loose (> $10) may accept poor matches\n",
    "3. **Monitor iteration count distribution** - If most tasks hit max iterations, convergence threshold may be unrealistic\n",
    "4. **Implement timeout per iteration** - Prevent single iteration from blocking (e.g., 30s max per iteration)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 1: No convergence detection** - Without early stop, workflow always runs max iterations even if task converged at iteration 2 (wastes cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 2: Missing progress validation** - If discrepancy increases (regression), reflection insights may be misguiding the agent. Need to validate monotonic improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Pitfall 3: Insufficient reflection context** - If reflection doesn't include specific failure details (which transactions failed? why?), next iteration can't improve effectively."

    "**Path 1: Pattern Explorer (Quick Start)**\n",
    "1. [Sequential Baseline](08_sequential_orchestration_baseline.ipynb) → [Hierarchical](09_hierarchical_delegation_pattern.ipynb) → This notebook → [State Machine](11_state_machine_orchestration.ipynb) → [Benchmark](14_agentarch_benchmark_reproduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path 2: Reliability Engineer**\n",
    "1. [Agent Reliability Fundamentals](../tutorials/01_agent_reliability_fundamentals.md) → [Error Propagation](../tutorials/04_error_propagation_analysis.md) → This notebook → [Reliability Framework](13_reliability_framework_implementation.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path 3: Complete Mastery**\n",
    "1. Complete all concept tutorials (01-07) → Complete all pattern notebooks (08-12) → [Reliability Framework](13_reliability_framework_implementation.ipynb) → [Benchmark Reproduction](14_agentarch_benchmark_reproduction.ipynb) → [Production Deployment](15_production_deployment_tutorial.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment**: Try different convergence thresholds ($0.01, $0.10, $1.00, $10.00) and observe convergence rate changes\n",
    "- **Compare**: Run same reconciliation tasks through sequential workflow (no refinement) and compare success rates\n",
    "- **Extend**: Add 4th refinement strategy (counterparty name fuzzy matching) to handle missing_counterparty challenges\n",
