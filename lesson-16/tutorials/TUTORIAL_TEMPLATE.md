### Implementation Details

**Code walkthrough:**

```python
# Reference from actual backend implementation
# Include file path and line numbers in comments
# lesson-16/backend/[module]/[file].py:XX-YY

def example_function(param: Type) -> ReturnType:
    """
    Docstring explaining the function's role in the concept.
    """
    # Step 1: Type validation (defensive coding)
    if not isinstance(param, Type):
        raise TypeError("param must be Type")

    # Step 2: Main logic
    result = process(param)

    # Step 3: Return
    return result
```
