# /explore - Codebase Analysis and Understanding

Use this command to analyze and understand codebases, especially when starting work on a new feature or debugging issues.

## Usage
```
/explore [optional: specific file or directory]
```

## What it does
- Analyzes the codebase structure and architecture
- Identifies key components, patterns, and dependencies
- Provides insights into how different parts interact
- Suggests areas for improvement or potential issues
- Creates a mental model of the system for effective development

## Best practices
- Use before starting new features to understand context
- Run when debugging complex issues across multiple files
- Use to onboard new team members or AI assistants
- Combine with `/issue` to create well-informed task breakdowns

## Example
```
/explore src/api/
```

This will analyze the API layer and provide insights about its structure, patterns, and how it fits into the larger system.
