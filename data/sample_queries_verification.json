It\u2019s a great use of leftovers, and perfect for a satisfying dinner.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds\n* 2 teaspoons salt\n* 1/4 cup olive oil\n* 2 cups marinara sauce\n* 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n* 3 large eggs\n* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n* Fresh basil leaves, for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. **Prepare the Eggplant:** Lay the eggplant slices on a large baking sheet and sprinkle both sides with salt. Let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out the moisture. Pat them dry with a paper towel afterward.\n\n2. **Coat the Eggplant:** Place the flour in a shallow dish. In another shallow bowl, beat the eggs. Dip each eggplant slice first into the flour, shaking off the excess, and then into the beaten eggs.\n\n3. **Cook the Eggplant:** Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant slices in batches, cooking until golden brown on each side (about 3-4 minutes per side). Remove from skillet and set on a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n4. **Assemble the Dish:** Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of fried eggplant slices over the sauce. Cover with some of the mozzarella cheese and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers \u2014 sauce, eggplant, mozzarella, Parmesan \u2014 until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese.\n\n5. **Bake:** Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.\n\n6. **Garnish and Serve:** Let the dish cool for a few minutes, then garnish with fresh basil leaves. Serve hot.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* For a healthier version, you can bake the eggplant slices instead of frying: lay them on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) until golden.\n* Make sure to use a good quality marinara sauce, as it greatly impacts the flavor of the dish.\n* If you have any leftover vegetables like zucchini or mushrooms, you can add them to the layers for extra heartiness.",
