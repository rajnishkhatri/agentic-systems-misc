        "1. Initializing PhaseLogger for workflow tracking\n",
        "2. Phase lifecycle: `start_phase` → `log_decision` → `log_artifact` → `end_phase`\n",
        "3. Working with different workflow phases (Planning, Data Collection, Execution, Validation)\n",
        "4. Decision logging with reasoning, alternatives considered, and selection rationale\n",
        "5. Artifact tracking with metadata (file type, path, phase association)\n",
        "6. Error handling: recoverable vs fatal errors\n",
        "7. Generating Mermaid workflow diagrams with `visualize_workflow()`\n",
        "8. Summarizing workflow statistics with `get_phase_summary()`\n",

        "## AgentRxiv Background\n",

        "- **Compliance auditing**: Track every decision made during multi-step processes\n",
        "- **Debugging**: Understand why an agent made specific choices\n",
        "- **Reproducibility**: Document the reasoning behind workflow outcomes\n"
