# Social Media Draft: Cherry-Picked Benchmarks

**Platform:** LinkedIn / Twitter
**Tone:** Professional, Educational, slightly provocative

**Headline:** Is your AI model actually 99% accurate, or did you just pick the easy questions? 🍒

We've all seen the charts. "Our model beats GPT-4!" "99.9% Fraud Detection!"
But when you deploy it to production, performance tanks. Why?

**The Cherry-Picked Benchmark Fallacy.**

It's easy to look like a genius when you grade your own homework on questions you've already seen.

I've built an interactive tutorial to help AI engineers:
1. **Understand** the "Cherry-Picked Benchmark" fallacy.
2. **Detect** it using data distribution analysis (Pólya Phase 2).
3. **Audit** claims with SQL and Python (Pólya Phase 3).
4. **Counter** it using rigorous stratified splitting (Pólya Phase 6).

Check out the "AI Logical Fallacies" system. It breaks down the claim, visualizes the data bias, and gives you the code to fix it.

Don't let "Marketing Accuracy" fool your "Engineering Reality".
