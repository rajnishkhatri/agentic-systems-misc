## 🛠️ How to Use This System

Each tutorial follows a structured **6-Phase Flow**:

1.  **Understand:** Define the fallacy with real-world examples.
2.  **Plan:** Develop a detection strategy.
3.  **Tasks:** detailed checklist of verification steps.
4.  **Execute:** Walk through a concrete scenario (Roleplay).
5.  **Reflect:** Quiz yourself and connect patterns.
6.  **Counter:** Learn the "Antidote" methodology (Code/Math).
