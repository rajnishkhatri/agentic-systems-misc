The store assured me that the refund would be processed within a week. It's been over two weeks now, and I still haven't seen any changes on my credit card statement. I understand these things can take time, but I'm starting to get a bit worried. Could you please look into this for me? Thank you so much for your help! (Network: Visa)",
