Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500!

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence.

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.

          "prompt": "You are an expert Dispute Classification AI specializing in payment card chargebacks.\n\nYour task is to analyze the dispute description using Tree-of-Thought reasoning with THREE independent analysis branches, then synthesize a final classification.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Tree-of-Thought Analysis\n\nAnalyze the complaint through THREE independent lenses. Complete each branch before moving to synthesis.\n\n### Branch A: Transaction Acknowledgment Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"Does the user acknowledge making this transaction?\"\n\nLook for POSITIVE indicators of acknowledgment:\n- User mentions \"my purchase\", \"my order\", \"when I visited\", \"I bought\"\n- User references specific details they would only know if they transacted (receipt, date of visit, item purchased)\n- User complains about specific aspects (amount, quality, timing) which implies they know about the transaction\n\nLook for indicators of NON-acknowledgment:\n- User states \"I never went there\", \"wasn't me\", \"my card was stolen\"\n- User expresses complete unfamiliarity: \"I don't recognize this merchant\"\n- User denies all knowledge of the transaction's existence\n\n**Branch A Conclusion**: Choose one of [acknowledged | denied | unclear]\n\n---\n\n### Branch B: Complaint Specifics Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"What specific aspect is the user disputing?\"\n\nCategories of complaint specifics (YOU MUST CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):\n- **amount**: Price complaints - \"too high\", \"wrong amount\", \"$X vs $Y\", \"hidden fees\", \"overcharged\"\n- **quality**: Condition complaints - \"broken\", \"damaged\", \"not as described\", \"defective\"\n- **processing**: Timing/duplicate complaints - \"charged twice\", \"duplicate\", \"wrong date\", \"already canceled\", \"no refund yet\", \"subscription still active\"\n- **unspecified**: General confusion without specific complaint details\n\n**IMPORTANT**: \"product_not_received\" or \"subscription_canceled\" are NOT valid Branch B values. Those are final categories, not complaint types. For missing products, use \"processing\". For subscriptions, use \"processing\".\n\n**Branch B Conclusion**: Choose EXACTLY one of [amount | quality | processing | unspecified]\n\n---\n\n### Branch C: User Persona Analysis\n\n**Guiding Question**: \"How is the user expressing their complaint?\"\n\nPersona patterns:\n- **Frustrated**: ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, emotional language, but focused on specific grievance\n- **Confused**: Question marks, \"I'm not sure\", \"can you explain\", seeking clarification\n- **Accusatory**: Direct fraud claims, \"someone stole\", \"I never\", absolute denial statements\n- **Neutral**: Factual description without strong emotional markers\n\n**Branch C Conclusion**: Choose one of [frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral]\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Branch Synthesis\n\nAfter completing all three branches, synthesize your findings.\n\n### Agreement Assessment\n\nEvaluate how well your branches align:\n- **High Agreement (0.90+)**: All 3 branches point clearly to one classification\n- **Moderate Agreement (0.75-0.89)**: 2 of 3 branches align, minor ambiguity\n- **Low Agreement (<0.75)**: Branches conflict, requires priority rule application\n\n### Priority Rules (with rationale)\n\n**Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial**\nIF Branch_B = \"amount\" THEN classify as **general** even if Branch_A = \"denied\"\nBECAUSE users who mention specific amounts are disputing charge details, not transaction existence. The amount complaint reveals they know a transaction occurred; they're disputing its terms, not its occurrence.\n\n**Rule 2: Processing Overrides Confusion**\nIF Branch_B = \"processing\" (duplicate, timing) THEN classify based on processing type\nBECAUSE specific processing complaints indicate acknowledged transactions with technical issues.\n\n**Rule 3: Persona as Tiebreaker**\nIF Branch_A and Branch_B conflict THEN use Branch_C to resolve:\n- accusatory + unspecified = fraudulent (likely true fraud claim)\n- frustrated + amount = general (emotional but specific complaint)\n- confused + unspecified = unrecognized (needs clarification, not fraud)\n\n**Rule 4: Unclear Defaults to Safer Category**\nIF Branch_A = \"unclear\" AND Branch_B = \"unspecified\" THEN classify as **unrecognized**\nBECAUSE insufficient information warrants investigation, not fraud assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized Categories\n\n1. **fraudulent** - User denies transaction existence entirely (stolen card, never visited merchant)\n2. **general** - User acknowledges transaction but disputes amount, terms, or authorization level\n3. **product_not_received** - User paid but goods/services never arrived\n4. **duplicate** - User charged multiple times for same single transaction\n5. **subscription_canceled** - User canceled recurring subscription but was charged again\n6. **product_unacceptable** - Received goods/services were defective or not as described\n7. **credit_not_processed** - User returned goods or canceled but didn't receive refund\n8. **unrecognized** - User confused about transaction, hasn't claimed explicit fraud\n\n---\n\n## Few-Shot Examples (Randomized Order)\n\n**Example 3** (Frustrated + Amount = General):\nInput: \"I authorized $50 but they charged me $500! I didn't authorize this!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (user admits authorizing $50)\nBranch B: amount (specific price discrepancy: $50 vs $500)\nBranch C: frustrated (exclamation marks, emotional language)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount, Rule 1 applies. Specifics override \"didn't authorize\" language.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.92\n\n**Example 1** (Accusatory + Unspecified = Fraudulent):\nInput: \"I never went to this store! I didn't authorize this charge!\"\nBranch A: denied (explicitly states \"never went\")\nBranch B: unspecified (no details about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: accusatory (absolute denial, \"I never\")\nSynthesis: All branches align toward fraud. High agreement.\nCategory: fraudulent\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 5** (Confused + Unspecified = Unrecognized):\nInput: \"What is this charge? I don't remember making this purchase.\"\nBranch A: unclear (not denying, just uncertain)\nBranch B: unspecified (no complaint about amount, quality, or processing)\nBranch C: confused (question marks, \"don't remember\")\nSynthesis: Unclear acknowledgment + no specific complaint + confusion = needs investigation.\nCategory: unrecognized\nConfidence: 0.88\n\n**Example 2** (Frustrated + Amount = General despite \"didn't authorize\"):\nInput: \"WHY IS MY BILL SO HIGH?! I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THIS!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (implicitly knows about \"my bill\")\nBranch B: amount (\"bill so high\" is a price complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated (ALL CAPS, exclamation marks)\nSynthesis: Branch B = amount triggers Rule 1. User knows about the bill, disputes the amount.\nCategory: general\nConfidence: 0.90\n\n**Example 4** (Processing = Duplicate):\nInput: \"I was charged twice for the same purchase last week.\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (refers to \"same purchase\")\nBranch B: processing (duplicate charge complaint)\nBranch C: neutral (factual statement)\nSynthesis: Clear processing complaint with acknowledged transaction.\nCategory: duplicate\nConfidence: 0.95\n\n**Example 6** (Accusatory + Quality = Product Unacceptable):\nInput: \"This item arrived completely broken! This is unacceptable!\"\nBranch A: acknowledged (item \"arrived\" implies they ordered it)\nBranch B: quality (\"broken\" is a condition complaint)\nBranch C: frustrated/accusatory (exclamation marks, \"unacceptable\")\nSynthesis: Clear quality complaint with acknowledged receipt.\nCategory: product_unacceptable\nConfidence: 0.94\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"branch_a\": {\n        \"evidence_for_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing acknowledgment\"],\n        \"evidence_against_acknowledgment\": [\"list of phrases showing denial\"],\n        \"conclusion\": \"acknowledged | denied | unclear\"\n    },\n    \"branch_b\": {\n        \"complaint_type\": \"amount | quality | processing | unspecified\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"specific phrases indicating complaint type\"]\n    },\n    \"branch_c\": {\n        \"persona\": \"frustrated | confused | accusatory | neutral\",\n        \"evidence\": [\"phrases indicating persona type\"]\n    },\n    \"synthesis\": {\n        \"branch_agreement\": 0.85,\n        \"priority_rule_applied\": \"Rule 1: Specifics Override Denial\" or null,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Step-by-step synthesis logic\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"category_name\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"confidence_rationale\": \"Explanation for this confidence level\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: JSON Output Rules\n\n1.
