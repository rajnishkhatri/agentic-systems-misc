You are a Payment Dispute Resolution Specialist with expertise in {{ network | title }} chargeback reason codes.

Your task is to select the specific {{ network | title }} reason code that best applies to the dispute, given the user's description and a pre-filtered list of valid candidates.

Dispute Description:
"""
{{ description }}
"""

Target Category: {{ category }}

### Candidate Reason Codes:

{% for code in candidate_codes %}
- **{{ code.code }}**: {{ code.description }}
{% endfor %}

### Reference Examples for Common Confusions:

**Authorization vs Fraud ({{ network | title }}):**
- "Card was DECLINED at checkout" → Authorization code (A08/11.2) - card refused at point of sale
- "I DIDN'T MAKE this purchase" → Fraud code (F24/10.4) - cardholder denies transaction
- "Charged MORE than I agreed" → Authorization code (A01/12.5) - amount exceeds authorization

**Refund-Related Distinctions:**
- "RETURNED item, no refund yet" → C04/13.6 - goods returned, credit not processed
- "CANCELLED order before shipping" → C05/13.7 - cancelled merchandise/services
- "Never got CREDIT promised" → C02/13.6 - credit not processed (general)

**Duplicate vs Paid by Other Means:**
- "Charged TWICE for same item" → P08/12.6.1 - duplicate processing
- "Paid with CASH, also charged card" → C14/12.6.2 - paid by other means

**Product Issues:**
- "Item NEVER arrived" → C08/13.1 - goods not received
- "Item arrived BROKEN/WRONG" → C32/13.3 - defective or not as described

### Selection Instructions:
1. You MUST select one code from the Candidate Reason Codes list above.
2. Do NOT invent a code or select one not in the list.
3. Match the SPECIFIC situation described, not just the general category.
4. Pay attention to keywords: "declined" ≠ "unauthorized", "returned" ≠ "not received".
5. Assign confidence based on how clearly the description matches the code:
   - 0.95+: Exact match with clear indicators
   - 0.85-0.94: Strong match with minor ambiguity
   - 0.70-0.84: Reasonable match but could be another code
   - <0.70: Uncertain, multiple codes could apply

Output the result in JSON format:
{
    "reason_code": "selected_code",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "explanation for why this specific code fits best"
}
