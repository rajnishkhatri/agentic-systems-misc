Among all the added modules to the augmented LLM, memory is a key component needed to go from an LLM to an Agent. By themselves, LLMs are forgetful entities; they do not remember past conversations, nor do they have access to all actions they have taken. If you were to locally load up an LLM and ask it to remember your name, it can’t–not without explicitly giving it memory. In contrast, the interactions that you might have with hosted LLMs, like ChatGPT and Claude, are not regular LLMs. Rather, ...

Over the years, there has been significant attention to aspects of agents like tool usage, reasoning LLMs, and multi-agent collaboration. Each is quite important by itself, but don’t underestimate the importance of memory. Without memory, a personal assistant agent wouldn’t be able to remember past conversations. Without memory, a coding agent wouldn’t understand your entire codebase. Without memory, an Agent would forget that it has already taken a given action and keep on repeating it.

Short-term memory in Agents is the information it has about recent interactions, typically the ongoing conversations with the user or the behavior of the LLM. In practice, this is the conversation history of the LLM, which serves as context for generating responses. Illustrated in Figure 4-5, they are generally formatted as messages demonstrating the differences between system prompts, the user’s query, and the LLM’s answer. It is a conversation where the user tells something about themselves, n...

Working memory is a type of short-term memory that is typically defined as a system with limited capacity that temporarily holds information that we need for things like decision-making and reasoning. For LLMs, it is typically data that persists across LLM calls. More specifically, it is the chat history of the LLM that is being stored in memory and continuously fed back to the LLM.

Involves remembering specific events and experiences from one’s past (e.g., your last birthday party). For agents, this typically involves specific actions the agent has taken thus far and their outcomes....
