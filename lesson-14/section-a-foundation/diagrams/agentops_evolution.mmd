```

**Diagram Purpose:** Visualize the progression from DevOps to AgentOps, showing how each "Ops" paradigm builds upon the previous one while introducing new challenges and practices specific to increasingly complex AI systems.

**Key Insights:**
1. **DevOps (2000s)**: Foundation with CI/CD, monitoring, version control for deterministic software
2. **MLOps (2010s)**: Added non-determinism, data dependency, drift detection for ML models
3. **FMOps (2020s)**: Scaled to large foundation models with fine-tuning and prompt engineering
4. **GenAIOps (2023)**: Specialized for generative AI with prompt/RAG operations
5. **AgentOps (2024+)**: Most complex layer with tools, orchestration, memory, and multi-step reasoning
