    "## Why Evaluation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 4.2.2**: Conceptual section - Why evaluation matters, LLM-as-judge vs. metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Evaluation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM outputs are **non-deterministic** and **difficult to assess**:\n",
    "- Traditional unit tests (`assert output == expected`) don't work for generative AI\n",
    "- Human evaluation is expensive and doesn't scale\n",
    "- Quality metrics vary by use case (accuracy, helpfulness, tone, citations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Evaluation Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Quantitative Metrics** (This Tutorial)\n",
    "- **Measurable**: Ideal count, length, diversity, response time\n",
    "- **Fast**: Run on every output, no LLM calls needed\n",
    "- **Objective**: Same input always produces same score\n",
    "- **Limitations**: May miss semantic quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Keyword quality evaluation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Ideal: 5 keywords per article\n",
    "score = 1.0 - abs(len(keywords) - 5) / 5.0\n",
    "# 5 keywords → score = 1.0 (perfect)\n",
    "# 3 keywords → score = 0.6 (penalty for too few)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **LLM-as-Judge** (Covered in llm_as_judge_tutorial.ipynb)\n",
    "- **Semantic**: Evaluates meaning, correctness, helpfulness\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Can assess subjective qualities (tone, creativity)\n",
    "- **Costly**: Requires LLM API calls for each evaluation\n",
    "- **Bias risk**: Judge LLM may have preferences or blind spots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Correctness evaluation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "judge_prompt = f\"\"\"Rate the accuracy of this answer (0-10):\n",
    "Question: {question}\n",
    "Answer: {llm_answer}\n",
    "Ground Truth: {reference_answer}\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "score = await judge_llm.evaluate(judge_prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composable App Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The composable app evaluates **keyword quality** for generated articles:\n",
    "- **Metric 1**: Ideal count (5 keywords is optimal for search indexing)\n",
    "- **Metric 2**: Diversity (keywords should cover different aspects)\n",
    "- **Source**: `evals.log` records every AI-generated draft\n",
    "- **Goal**: Identify systematic issues (e.g., GenAIWriter always generates 8 keywords)\n",

    "### Metric 1: Ideal Count Penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Prefer exactly 5 keywords (common best practice for search indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: `penalty = abs(len(keywords) - 5) / 5.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- `5 keywords`: penalty = 0.0 → score = 1.0 ✅ (perfect)\n",

Penalize verbosity.\"\n3. **Control group**: Include known reference articles of varying lengths\n\n#### 3. **Self-Preference Bias**\n**Issue**: Judge (same model as generator) favors its own outputs\n\n**Example**:\n- Generator: Gemini 2.0\n- Judge: Gemini 2.0 (same model)\n- Result: Gemini judges its own style favorably, penalizes other models\n\n**Solution**: Use different model for judge\n```python\n# Generator\nwriter_agent = Agent('gemini-2.0-flash', ...)\n\n# Judge: Use different model family\njudge_agent = Agent('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', ...)  # Different model\n```\n\n#### 4. **Prompt Sensitivity**\n**Issue**: Small wording changes in judge prompt cause large score swings\n\n**Example**:\n- Prompt A: \"Rate quality (0-10)\" → Mean score: 6.5\n- Prompt B: \"Rate excellence (0-10)\" → Mean score: 4.2 (stricter interpretation)\n\n**Solution**: Calibrate prompts with ground truth dataset\n```python\n# Step 1: Create calibration set with human ratings\ncalibration = [\n    {\"article\": article1, \"human_score\": 8},\n    {\"article\": article2, \"human_score\": 5},\n    # ... 20-50 examples\n]\n\n# Step 2: Test prompt variants\nfor prompt_version in [\"v1\", \"v2\", \"v3\"]:\n    judge_scores = [await judge.evaluate(item[\"article\"], prompt_version) \n                    for item in calibration]\n    human_scores = [item[\"human_score\"] for item in calibration]\n    \n    # Step 3: Measure correlation\n    from scipy.stats import pearsonr\n    correlation, p_value = pearsonr(judge_scores, human_scores)\n    \n    print(f\"{prompt_version}: r={correlation:.3f} (p={p_value:.3f})\")\n    # Choose prompt with highest correlation to human judgment\n```\n\n### Best Practices for Reducing Bias\n\n1. **Randomization**: Shuffle presentation order, use multiple judges\n2. **Calibration**: Validate against human ratings on sample dataset\n3. **Cross-validation**: Use multiple judge models, average scores\n4. **Explicit criteria**: Provide concrete rubric (see structured outputs above)\n5. **Anchoring**: Include reference examples (\"Score 5 looks like..., Score 10 looks like...\")\n6. **Blind evaluation**: Remove identifying information (author, model name)\n\n### Example: Multi-Judge Consensus\n\n**Reduce bias by averaging scores from multiple judge models:**\n\n```python\n# Use 3 different judge models\njudges = [\n    Agent('gemini-2.0-flash'),\n    Agent('gpt-4o'),\n    Agent('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')\n]\n\n# Get scores from all judges\nscores = []\nfor judge in judges:\n    result = await judge.evaluate(article)\n    scores.append(result.overall_score)\n\n# Average scores (reduces individual model bias)\nconsensus_score = np.mean(scores)\nvariance = np.var(scores)\n\nif variance > 2.0:\n    print(f\"⚠️ High variance ({variance:.1f}) - judges disagree!\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"✅ Consensus score: {consensus_score:.1f} (low variance)\")\n```\n\n**When to use multi-judge**:\n- ✅ High-stakes evaluations (production deployment decisions)\n- ✅ Subjective qualities (tone, creativity, helpfulness)\n- ❌ Cost-sensitive scenarios (3x API costs)\n- ❌ Simple objective metrics (use quantitative instead)",
